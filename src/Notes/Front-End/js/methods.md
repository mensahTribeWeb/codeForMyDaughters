#JavaScript: Methods

In JavaScript methods are properties that contain function definition

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

  -a period (the dot operator)
  -the name of the method
 -opening and closing parentheses
 -a function set to the object

###Syntax
```
 -'objectName.methodName();'
 -'if the object is called without parenthesis this called a property'
```

###.isInteger(x);
```
  -'a method from the NUMBER object that determines if a value's a Integer'
```
