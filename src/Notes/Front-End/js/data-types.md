<h1>JavaScript: Data Types</h1>

<p>There are 7 data types which classifies different types of data</p>

<p>seven fundamental data types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  Number: any type of number including decimals: 1, 100, 56.65, 3.14
  </li>
  <li>
    String: a grouping of characters that are surrounded by '...' or "...."
  </li>
  <li>
    Boolean: true or false
  </li>
  <li>
    Null: null w/o quotation an intentional absence of value
  </li>
  <li>
    Undefined: also used to represent the absence of data, but this is used when the value does not exist 
  </li>
  <li>
    Symbol:symbol for unique identifiers, this is fairly new to me
  </li>
  <li>
    Object: a collection of related data
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  the first 6 are primitive data types, objects are a collection of the the primitive types usually.
