# AWS:Cloud Practitioner Essential

## Module 1 introduction

Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn how to:

- Summarize the benefits of AWS.
- Describe differences between on-demand delivery and cloud deployments.
- Summarize the pay-as-you-go pricing model.

## Fundamental Cloud Concepts

 Server: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
  -a virtual server
  -server validates the request
  -responds with a response

### You only pay for what you use
  -you don't prepay

### Cloud Computing
- The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

On-demand delivery: indicates Aws has the resources you need when you need it.
- you don't need to ask for service a head of time.
- flexible

Undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT: task that are common aws helps so you can focus on other aspects

### Cloud-Based Deployment model
- Runs all parts of the application in the cloud
- Migrate existing application to the cloud
- Design and build new application in the cloud
- you can migrate app to the cloud or build in the cloud
  - can be built on low level infrastructure
  - can be built with higher level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements

### On-Premises Deployment model
- Deploy services using virtualization and resource management tools.
- legacy IT

### Hybrid Deployment model
- a combination of cloud-based and on-premises infrastructure.
- combine cloud with legacy
