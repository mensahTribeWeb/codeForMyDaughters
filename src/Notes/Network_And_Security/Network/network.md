#Intro to Networks

##Ch 1. Computer Network Fundamentals

###what is a computer network?

**computer network** 
    a collection of Nodes(computers) connected via wireless or cable
    such as Ethernet or fiber optic cable. wi-fi is ent via radio waves

 **Ethernet**  
    a technology used to connect devices(nodes) to a network (local or wide-area)
    the ethernet is the cable connected to our router

**Topologies**
    the techniques used to connect computers(nodes) the most come is
    the star
    
  **Star topology**
    a central node extends cable(or wireless) to each computer
    on the network. computers are connected independently of the center.
    
  _Advantage_
        straight forward connection from the center. since they 
        have their own connection, the loss of one node will not
        break the entire system. also, it is easy to add another
        node to the network.
   _Disadvantage_ 
        the issue with star is its single point of failure. if
        the hub fails all nodes fail.
        so have fail over servers backups in order to keep the
        main server going until you fix the main server.


   **Bus Topology**
    all nodes are connected to a single cable, all information that needs
    to reach the last node must pass through all nodes
    
   _Advantage_
        you will use a minimal amount of cables
   _Disadvantages_ 
        if the cable is broken all the nodes will shut down

   **Ring Topology**
    the nodes are connected to the server on a central node that are all
    connected via a single cable without an end. the information is 
    circulated until the intended recipient is reached

  _Disadvantages_
   If a network node is not configured properly, or it is down 
    temporarily for another reason, the signal will make a number of 
    attempts to find its destination.

   **collapsed ring**
    the central node will be a router or a switch. a ring topology is used 
    internally and features plugin cables each node has an independent
    cable. offices usually have a cable closet containing switch devices
    that connect the network. wth wireless available nodes are connected
    to a central router, which is connected to the main server.

   **Cable Types**

  cables are conductive media that allows the signals to flow. the signal can be an 
  electric pulse or flicker. the type of signal is defined by the type of cable.
    all cables have a limit to how far they can carry a signal it is call _attenuation_ .

  **Coaxial cables**
    a cable with a central copper wire covered by insulation, its often seen used with cable television
    
 **twisted copper cable**
   cooper wires twisted together (ethernet cable) plastic insulation. these use to be use in telephone
    wires cables can range from five to seven. they can withstand high level of noise, which makes
    the signal efficient. each cooper wire has its own touch point.

 **fiber optic**
   a cable with a core made of a glass strand which carries light. signal can carry a longer distance
    without the need to repeat the signal, which makes carrying more data much faster for a single user
    its flows near the speed of light.
    fiber optic is gaining popularity because higher bandwidth and greater network speed 

### ___focus on:___
   computer networks are a set of nodes connected by a cable. the internet is a big network. 
   the most common topology is the star other topologies are called ring and bus.
    connections utilize coaxial cables, fiber optic or the popular twisted copper wire
    networks allow for data to be shared more efficiently

###Importance of communication

  **Communication Networks**
 **1. File Sharing: Multimedia**
 **2. Hardware Sharing: Backup and Recovery**
 **3. Messaging and Communicating**
 **4. Web Access: Web Browser Applications**
